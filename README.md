# ImagineAI



Full-stack web app for children to explore their creativity using AI. Users can generate fully illustrated storybooks, write stories with the help of AI-generated prompts, and turn sketches into masterpieces with the click of a button. 




## Features
 

* **Customisable AI generated stories:** Create an unlimited number of fully illustrated stories. User gives a brief description of the story they want to write, the characters and setting.

* **Collaborative stories:** User can write stories with friends. A collaborative story generates a random writing prompt for users and 10 guiding questions for them to complete the story.

Users can also generate a cover for their story and accompanying images from the paragraphs they've written.
