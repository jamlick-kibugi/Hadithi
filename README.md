# ImagineAI



Full-stack web app for children to explore their creativity using AI. Users can generate fully illustrated storybooks, write stories with the help of AI-generated prompts, and turn sketches into masterpieces with the click of a button. 




## Features
 

* **Customisable AI generated stories:** Create an unlimited number of fully illustrated stories. User gives a brief description of the story they want to write, the characters and setting. User can also specify the genre of the story, the intended age of the target audience ( toddlers or pre-teens), and the length/no. of pages of their story.

* **Collaborative stories:** User can write stories with friends. A collaborative story generates a random writing prompt for users and 10 guiding questions for them to complete the story. Collaborative stories can be shared with other users so they can contribute to the story writing. Users can also generate a cover for their story and accompanying images from the paragraphs they've written.
